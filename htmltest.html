      <h2>Data and Weights</h2>
      <p>
        Our data is stored in <code>data.csv</code>, which contains details about individualsâ€”such as name, undergrad institution, grad school, employer, location, hobbies, and drinks.
        A second file, <code>weights.csv</code>, defines the relative importance (weights) for each field.

      <h2>Building the Undirected Knowledge Graph</h2>
      <p>
        We construct an undirected knowledge graph by representing each person and each trait (e.g., education, employer, etc.) as nodes.
        Edges connect people to their traits using weights derived from <code>weights.csv</code>.

      <h2>Learning Node Embeddings & Repositioning</h2>
      <p>
        Next, we learn vector embeddings for each node using a simple machine learning model.
        These embeddings capture similarities between nodes.
        We then reposition the person nodes using Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) so that similar people appear closer together.
        When you hover over a node in the embedded graph below, you'll see a list of other people ordered by closeness along with their similarity scores.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The above visualizations illustrate our process:
        We start with <code>data.csv</code> and <code>weights.csv</code> to build an undirected knowledge graph.
        We then learn node embeddings that capture relationships and reposition the people nodes based on similarity.
        Hover details provide additional insight into how similar each person is to the others.
